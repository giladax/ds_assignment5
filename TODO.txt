TODO!!

1. Sort X values (Check last index of given point array. 
				  If value is less than or equal to n-1, use Bucket Sort (Because it's either the first company with this index in order or the second company with max value = n-1. 
				  Else, the array is sorted, just deep copy it). 
Build a Sorted Heap (for X values) using the previously sorted array.
Build a second Heap (not sorted) for Y values. This will take O(N)
				  
2. getPointsInRange: Find XLeft (Binary search - O(logN)) and select all k values till XRight.
3. FIND A WAY TO KEEP X HEAP ORDERED! Or find a different solution for getPointsInRange


Use question 2 in the practice (ClogC).
